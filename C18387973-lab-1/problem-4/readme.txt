This is to stop spoilers from happening on the web, or if something accidently comes up like on twitter, elements would be changed as to not give me spoilers
I picked squid game for example because there has been lots of spoilers because it is so popular. it will changes.

What worked from my implementation:
- when the squid game word appears, the word warning comes up instead. To expand, I could do it on other spoiler words as well.
- The background colour changes blue- random feature I wanted to try out
- The images change to give spoiler warning images or gif instead
- removes video content from page

I tried to implement these features, but they didn't work out, but I left the code in for attempt marks, if given:)
These are the failed features:
- to change the link to the social media of the charachters. Currently clicking to the name of the character on some with href takes to the character profile, but I wanted to change it to their insta instead.


These are the website, that I used to check up if my implementations worked.

There was limit to what I can do and limit to my knowledge, so this idea couldn't be implemented to the best, that it could be.
